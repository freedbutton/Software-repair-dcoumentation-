# Software-repair-dcoumentation-
A helpful collection of software repair commands for currently windows and mac. I am trying to add to this regularly to hopfully create a one stop shop for all Computer repairs. With Windows, Mac, and linux repair commands and troubleshooting steps. 
This is all things Ive had to look up or forced to learn over the years and just wanted to give myself a nice single place to look rather then having to go from tech article to tech article. So I guess fair warning most of this is not mine to a little collection of knowlage. 
Oh yea and all of this is wirtten for IT profeesionals or the likes so most of this is not kinda dangrous to play mess up. So you have been worned.
